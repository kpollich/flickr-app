# Flickr Gallery

Write a vanilla web application that showcases artwork from the Flickr API.

- Display an initial set of artwork and allow for more images to be loaded
- Users should see thumbnails that can be clicked and expanded into a lightbox
- Keyboard navigation while the lightbox is open is encouraged
- Take the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of design fundamentals
- Use of third party libraries or frameworks is discouraged (CSS resets are fine)
- We'll be evaluating your submission using the latest stable version of Google Chrome

This is an open-ended exercise: we want to see what you're capable of, and what you care about. If you have time, feel free to make it your own and add any creative feature that you come up with!

Please accommodate to spend 4 hours on this exercise.
